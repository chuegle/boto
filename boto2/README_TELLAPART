This is a TellApart private branch of Boto. It's primary purpose it to rename
'boto' to 'boto2', so that we can import the current and a legacy version
simultaneously in our production code.

The source is hosted on the TellApart GitHub account. There is a script
'rename_2.sh' in the root folder can be used to convert a main branch to a
'boto2' branch.
